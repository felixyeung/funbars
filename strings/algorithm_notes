Start with a root Node.
For each word to search, go back to the root node.
    curr = root
    for each character in word
        examine current node for a link to this character.
        if such a link to the character exists in curr.links
            advance the current node to this character node
        if no such link exist
            create a new node for this character
            add a link to this new node from the curr node
            advance the curr node to this new node
    at this point, the current node should "complete the word."
